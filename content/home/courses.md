##### Introduction to Software and Systems Engineering

2020-1, 2020-3, [2019-2](https://classroom.google.com/u/0/c/Mzc0MjkzOTA0ODBa), ..., 2014-2 
(please email or chat for class code)

An undergraduate level course introducing basic software engineering concepts, activities (requirements management, configuration management, project management, testing, design and implementation, refactoring), techniques, and tools. This is a very practical hands-on course exploring in detail a single technique and tool for each activity, instead of overviewing a number of techniques and tools for each activity. The techniques and tools are applied in the context of software as a service, using Typescript, Angular, and Node.js. As learning these technologies is not the main focus of the course, we simply overview them.

##### Software Engineering

2020-1
(please email or chat for class material beyond the videos below)

An advanced undergraduate, basic graduate level course covering a larger range of software engineering concepts, activities, techniques, and tools. The previous course is a prerequisite to this one, where we cover more advanced topics and discuss a number of research papers.

##### Code Integration Tools and Techniques

[2019-2](https://classroom.google.com/u/0/c/Mzc0NzYxMjU0NDNa)
(please email or chat for class code)

An advanced undergraduate and graduate level course discussing code integration tools and techniques, including different kinds of merge tools (textual, syntactic, semantic), continuous integration and deployment, and integration conflict prediction. We discuss a number of research papers and technical blog posts, and students carry on an empirical study to either replicate one of the discussed studies or answer related research questions.
