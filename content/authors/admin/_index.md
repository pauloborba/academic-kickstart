I am Professor of Software Engineering at the [Informatics Center](http://www.cin.ufpe.br) ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=ioT7VK2MlxU)) of the Federal University of Pernambuco, where I lead the [Software Productivity Group](http://www.cin.ufpe.br/spg) ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGJnfGNKPsc&t=24s)). I am currently the Director of the Informatics Center. 

I investigate and develop tools and techniques for improving software development quality and productivity levels, especially by reducing unnecessary effort and frustration in software developers work activities. I pursue a mix of academic excellence with societal relevance.

My main research interests are in the following topics and their integration: advanced (semi-structured, structured, semantic) code merging tools, code integration conflicts, continuous integration and deployment, software modularity, software product lines, and refactoring.

I am a member of the ACM and of the Brazilian Computer Society.

I co-founded [Qualiti Software Processes](http://www.qualiti.com.br), a spin-off of the Informatics Center and [C.E.S.A.R.](http://www.cesar.org.br), specialized on software development tools and processes.

I have a D.Phil. in Computing from Oxford University, and an M.Sc. and a B.Sc. in Computer Science from Federal University of Pernambuco. I was Fulbright Visiting Faculty Scholar at [CMU](https://www.cs.cmu.edu)'s [Institute for Software Research](https://www.isri.cmu.edu/index.html) (currently the Software and Societal Systems Department).
